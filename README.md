# **Intro**
TravelPal is a travel app designed for individuals who prefer not to travel alone.

## What problem did you try to solve? 
To answer this question, let me share a brief story. ^^
A few months ago, I realized that my mother 👩  had become a solo traveler. As I've grown up and started to carve my own path in life, she's been left to travel alone. 🌎

She spent months trying to find a travel companion through various social platforms and among her friends, but to no avail. The common issue was that these individuals didn't share her enthusiasm for travel 🧳. They would often talk about the beauty of exploring the world, but never took any action.

### The problem: How can I assist people who are in the same situation as my mother? How can I connect them?
What if I could create an app that allows them to find destinations, purchase flight tickets, and connect with people who are heading in the same direction?

And thus, the idea for TravelPal was born. ✈️

## How does your app solve the problem?
Well, let's talk a bit about the app!
First of all, the user has to register/login. Then, he can search a departure airport, an arrival airport, a date for this journey and a list with all available flights will be displayed on the screen. 📺 
Of course, I you are an user of my app and you don't have idea where do you want to fly, you can leave that space empty and check all the existing routes from your city's airport. 😉

Then, I've created a special part for those who maybe don't want to fly in order to arrive somewhere, maybe they want to drive (or maybe they have a passsion to drive).

 Well, I cam with a solution for them also: 
-> Before the checkout, the user can check what options does he have if he wants to drive to the destination.
-> After he made his decision, he is invited to checkout. 
-> And now it comes the fun part: "Join the chat" button! 💬 

### Why is this part so funny?
Well, here you'll be added to the specific chat for your selected destination and this is the moment when you can connect with all the people that go in the same direction! You'll finally be able to talk to people that already bought a ticket 🎫 (just like you)! Now, the only thing that you have to do is to chat with them, schedule excursions, become friends, and many more! 😆
